U.R.F Soundscape
=============================
An App which converts events which happen during URF matches into a beautiful scenery of sound ranging from the inner city to tranquil nature. Use this for studying, or work, or just for relaxing.

This project is a fusion between sound design and programming.

# How to use
Use the slider on the middle of the screen to change the type of soundscape. Swipe it to the far left for a very inner city feel, far right to immerse yourself in the middle of a forest, to keep it inbetween to have a mixture - Suburbs, city edge!

# How it works
The LoL Match end-point provides a timeline data which has a sequence of events. We mapped those events into various pre-mixed sounds to create a natural (and suprisingly very realistic) soundscape. 

# Where to find it
It is deployed to Heroku
