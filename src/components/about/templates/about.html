</div>
<div class="modal-body">
    <p>This is an App which converts events which happen during U.R.F matches into a beautiful scenery of sound ranging from the inner city to tranquil nature. Use this for studying, or work, or just for relaxing. This project is a fusion between sound design and programming.</p>
    <h3>How to use</h3>
    <p>Use the slider on the middle of the screen to change the type of soundscape. Swipe it to the far left for a very inner city feel, far right to immerse yourself in the middle of a forest, to keep it inbetween to have a mixture - Suburbs, city edge!</p>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>The LoL Match end-point provides a timeline data which has a sequence of events. We mapped those events into various pre-mixed sounds to create a natural (and suprisingly very realistic) soundscape.</p>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p>App made in AngularJS and Express, and deployed to Heroku. Sound mixed with Apple Logic Pro. All sound is from freesound.org or recorded by Dolan Miu.</p>
    <!--<p>Below is a live feed of all the events which are happening currently.</p>
    <strong>Events:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li ng-repeat="event in events track by $index">
            {{ events }}
        </li>
    </ul>-->
